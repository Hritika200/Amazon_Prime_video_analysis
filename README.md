# Amazon_Prime_video_analysis
As a beginner in data visualization, there's no better way to learn than through hands-on projects. 
For instance, creating an Amazon Prime Video analysis dashboard using various maps and visualizations, with the dataset sourced from Kaggle, helped me to hone my skills in Tableau and creating a pretty dashboard of my most used streaming service.
